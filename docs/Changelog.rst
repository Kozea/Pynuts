Pynuts changelog

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Pynuts release.

Version 0.4.3

* Simplification of crud functions
* Handle permissions on links with auth_url_for with request/link params in acl rights functions

-----------
* The ``pynuts.Pynuts`` class no longer inherits from ``flask.Flask``.
* Pynuts no longer handles configuration. It uses Flaskâ€™s ``app.config``.

  expected to do that themselves.
